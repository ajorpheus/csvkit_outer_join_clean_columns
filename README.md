# Description

This repository contains a script that works around the absence of a no-duplicate-columns option for outer joins in csvjoin

# Related Links

See related issue: [CSVKit Issue#210 - _csvjoin includes columns on which it joins twice_](https://github.com/wireservice/csvkit/issues/210)

This was fixed in a [PR](https://github.com/wireservice/csvkit/pull/385 ) but that never made its way into csvkit master
